  Korean is a language known to lack agreement, but there is one salient agreement that happens; that is, honorific agreement. A basic example is that whenever the subject is suffixed with an honorifying nominal form, -kkeyse, it agrees with a verbal suffix, -si. The condition for honorific agreement is that the subject must have an honorifying feature [+hon] and has to be [+human]. Nevertheless, I newly introduce a case where honorifying verbal suffix -si is used even when the subject does not have a [+hon, +human] feature. I suggest that this is a type of allocutive agreement (i.e., morphosyntactic agreement with the hearer). Based on Speech Act projection suggested by Haegeman & Hill (2013), I propose a structural representation that integrates discourse participants into syntactic representation. I also predict the phenomenon by adopting the framework of cyclic Agree proposed by B√©jar & Rezac (2009).

  abstract      = {
  Language production is known to be realized in three stages, i.e., conceptualization, formulation, and articulation (Levelt, 1989). While various components have been identified as crucial factors to comprise the formulation stage, the influence of thematic roles during grammatical encoding remains controversial. This study examined the effect of thematic roles in the process of grammatical encoding. We conducted a sentence recall experiment using hit verbs and spray-load verbs under three conditions. The conditions were varied by the order and type of syntactic structures and thematic roles--NP(THEME)-PP(LOCATION), NP(LOCATION)-PP(THEME) and PP(LOCATION)-PP(THEME). We argue that during grammatical encoding, (a) thematic roles as well as syntactic structures are crucial factors, and (b) thematic role information outweighs syntactic structure information.

  Honorification has been considered as (a) simply an expressive construction (e.g., Kim & Sells 2007), (b) a syntactically-governed but morphologically implemented phenomenon (e.g., Choi & Harley 2019), or (c) purely syntactic agreement (e.g., Boeckx & Niinuma 2004). I introduce verbal suppletion in Korean with object honorification to better understand the phenomenon. The observation made here is in favor of an agreement-based approach to honorification. It also implies the possibility of taking honorificity as one of the ùúô-features (Corbett 2006).

  abstract     = {
  I present novel data from the Korean particle -ko and -nikka illustrating what I define as CALL-BACK function. At first glance the data might suggest that these are speech act (SA) operators. However, they are stackable to other particles and induce additional presuppositions. Moreover, they call back (a) propositions that were asserted in the common ground and (b) speech acts (e.g., assertion, question) that were performed in the context. My analysis extends to expressions such as ‚Äòagain or ‚Äòas previously mentioned, but differs from the previous discussion of Sauerland and Yatsushiro (2017).
