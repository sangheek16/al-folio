A collaborative work with Emre Hakg√ºder, Casey Ferrara, and Aurora Martinez del Rio (The University of Chicago) got accepted for a paper presentation at LSA 2021! The title of the paper is 'Identifying the Correlations Between the Lexical Semantics and Phonology of ASL: A Vector Space Approach'. Please join our talk on January 8rd, 2021. The full list of the LSA 2021 program can be found [here](https://www.linguisticsociety.org/node/34814/schedule). Stay tuned for the details of the time and (online) location.

[Short Abstract]
In this study, we create a semantic vector space model (VSM) for lexical word meaning in ASL and use it to investigate whether there is a relationship between the semantic and phonological properties of signs. We hypothesize that clusters of ASL words that are related in meaning are likely to have phonological similarities, basing our hypothesis on the many observations that transparent iconicity can be found at different levels of the grammar in sign languages, including at the lexical level. We show that the more neatly the ASL lexicon is semantically organized, the greater the phonological similarity within its clusters.
