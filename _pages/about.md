Hello!

I am a third year Linguistics PhD student at [the University of Chicago](https://linguistics.uchicago.edu/). I am a lab member of [The Language Processing Laboratory](https://lucian.uchicago.edu/blogs/lpl/), directed by [Ming Xiang](https://lucian.uchicago.edu/blogs/mingxiang/).

My research fields are psycholinguisitcs, computational linguistics, and syntax & semantics. I investigate how humans comprehend language in real-time. I am also interested in evaluating language models comparing to human performance.

I have a B.A. in English Language Education, which is a study of second language acquisition and foreign language teaching. I own a Secondary Teaching Certificate, granted by the Ministry of Education, Republic of Korea. In the past, I worked on bilinguals' and second language learners' acquisition and real-time comprehension of reflexive pronouns, past tense verb, and English articles.
