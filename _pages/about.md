Hello!

I am a third year Linguistics PhD student at [the University of Chicago](https://linguistics.uchicago.edu/). I am also a lab member of [Ming Xiang](https://lucian.uchicago.edu/blogs/mingxiang/)’s [Language Processing Laboratory](https://lucian.uchicago.edu/blogs/lpl/).

I mainly do psycholinguistics with a focus on semantics & pragmatics. I am interested in the language processing mechanism, and cognitive modeling. I also do computational linguistics as a side project, with a particular focus on the interpretability of language models.

I have a B.A. in Second Language Acquisition and Teaching. In the past, I have worked on L2 processing of reflexive resolution, and the acquisition of morphology and the article system.
