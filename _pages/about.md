Hello! I’m a second year Linguistics PhD student at [the University of Chicago](https://linguistics.uchicago.edu/). I’m also a lab member of [Ming Xiang](https://lucian.uchicago.edu/blogs/mingxiang/)’s [Language Processing Laboratory](https://lucian.uchicago.edu/blogs/lpl/).

I mainly do psycholinguistics with a focus on semantics & pragmatics. My research interest is on language representation, language processing mechanisms, and their intertwined relationship. I am also interested in computational modeling of language comprehension.

In the past, I have worked on reflexive resolution, relative clause processing, and sentence production related to thematic roles. I have a B.A. in Second Language Acquisition and Teaching, and I have worked on second language learners’ acquisition and processing of morphology and article system.
