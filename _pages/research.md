<h3> Current projects </h3>

I mainly do psycholinguistics, with a focus on semantics and pragmatics. I am particularly interested in sentence processing, and cognitive modeling. I also work on the evaluation of linguistic interpretability of language models. Click the toggle button to learn more about my ongoing projects.

<blockquote>
I tested how well the existing compositionality functions capture compositionlaity in natural language, particularly concerning ‘adjective + noun’ phrases. I used four types of existing categorization of adjectives that exhibit a different inferential pattern--intersective, subsective, non-subsective, and privative. I used a constant noun that uniformly combines with these four types of adjectives. Based on the <code>word2vec</code> model (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3781">Mikolov et al. 2013</a>), I evaluated compositionality of variants of the weighted additive and the multiplicative model (e.g., Mitchell & Lapata <a href="https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P08-1028/">2008</a>; <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1551-6709.2010.01106.x">2010</a>). The correlation coefficients with the newly collected human behavior result were used as an evaluation metric. The results showed that a certain type of weighted additive model performs better than the multiplicative model in general. Crucially, the results showed that the models perform differently depending on the type of the adjectives, which serve as evidence that the compositionality function may/should be tuned according to the adjective type. <i>Manuscript available upon request.</i>

Following this finding, I plan to explore the lexical function approach (Guevara, 2010; Baroni and Zamparelli, 2010; Bride et al., 2015; Vecchi et al., 2017) in the future, as this method assumes different matrices for each adjective. I am also currently exploring the compositionality of the four types of adjectives by using contextualized word embeddings (e.g. Shwartz and Dagan, 2019).
