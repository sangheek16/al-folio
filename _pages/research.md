<blockquote>
This paper explores a case of embedded attitude with the use of clause type particle and the attitudinal reportative particle in Korean. The crucial example here is a case where an embedded clause alone, headed by a complementizer -ko, is used as an independent utterance even when it is not used as a fragment answer. This structure, which I refer to as the STAND-ALONE -ko STRUCTURE, can not only embed different types of clause type particles (e.g., declarative, interrogative, and imperative) but also have different semantic meanings depending on the boundary tone that follows. I show that the stand-alone structure can be expressed as what I refer to as the FULL FORM, which contains a CP embedding NP. Grounded on an existing proposal on the choice of mood in relation to (non)veridicality, I argue that the stand-alone structure amounts to an embedded clause that encodes an epistemic agent’s attitude towards the embedded propositional content. I also suggest that the boundary tone has a function similar to that of speech act, expressing speaker’s certainty towards the CP embedding NP of the full form.

<blockquote>
I tested how well the existing compositionality functions capture compositionlaity in natural language, particularly concerning ‘adjective + noun’ phrases. I used four types of existing categorization of adjectives that exhibit a different inferential pattern--intersective, subsective, non-subsective, and privative. I used a constant noun that uniformly combines with these four types of adjectives. Based on the <code>word2vec</code> model ([Mikolov et al. 2013](https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3781)), I evaluated compositionality of variants of the weighted additive and the multiplicative model (e.g., Mitchell & Lapata [2008](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P08-1028/); [2010](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1551-6709.2010.01106.x)). The correlation coefficients with the newly collected human behavior result were used as an evaluation metric. The results showed that a certain type of weighted additive model performs better than the multiplicative model in general. Crucially, the results showed that the models perform differently depending on the type of the adjectives, which serve as evidence that the compositionality function may/should be tuned according to the adjective type.
<!-- Following this finding, I plan to explore the lexical function approach (Guevara, 2010; Baroni and Zamparelli, 2010; Bride et al., 2015; Vecchi et al., 2017) in the future, as this method assumes different matrices for each adjective. I can also extend the work of exploring the compositionality of the four types of adjectives by using contextualized word embeddings (e.g. Shwartz and Dagan, 2019). -->
